## RESTAURANT PAGE - The Odin Project

This is a project that's a part of the open source curriculum that I'm following called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

The aim of this project is to understand what [module](https://javascript.info/modules-intro) is in Javascript, and actually to use them to make your projects more managable.

## Newly Learned

In this project I start learning how to use Webpack and Javascript modules (import/export). I also continued practicing the DOM manipulation.

## Room for improvement

I need to improve my Git workflow, on how to develop more in the effective and organised way. For the projects to come I've to make sure I improvise git worfklow next project, making better commits.
